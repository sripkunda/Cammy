[Cammy](https://cammy.web.app) is a GNU markdown-based productivity tool that syncs directly with google calendar (support for more calendar applications coming soon).

## Download 

The download page for the latest Linux/OSX/Windows installation packages can be found [here](https://github.com/sripkunda/Cammy/releases). 

## FAQ

### What is it?

Cammy is a free to use, open source tool that allows you to plan out your day in a notepad-like environment while allowing you to sync your most important tasks and events with google calendar. 

### How does it work?

Cammy uses real-time natural language processing to identify dates, tasks, and events as you type. These dates and events are then parsed for important information, such as the title, duration, date, and time of the event/task. Once a match is found, Cammy will allow you to add a task to your calendar app with a single click.

### Why makes Cammy special?

Unlike modern productivity tools that restrict the structure and format of your todo lists and calendars to a single format, Cammy provides you with ultimate freedom, as if you are writing on a blank sheet of paper. This helps eliminate distractions and maintain a productive environment while working.

## Credits

This project would not be possible without [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor), the core of the markdown editor that has been modified to fit the editing needs of Cammy's real-time markdown-preview. Cammy also uses [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) for natural language processing (how Cammy recognizes events, tasks, dates, etc.).
